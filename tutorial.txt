Notes
-----
- always add files before commits



Brances
--------
Branches are basically a new version of the same repo, usually used for editing/debugging.
The main branch is referred to as the "master". All subsequent branches are to be created.

- git checkout -b branchname	# create a new branch

- git branch 					# see what branch you are on

- git checkout master 			# switch back to the master branch



Git ignore file

Remote Repos
------------

- git clone repoURL				# clone a repo on the current directory

- git remote
